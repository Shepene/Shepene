HI, I’m @Samson Victor by name and I’m interested in anything tech most especially cybersecurity.
I have long started developing myself and gaining the essential skills and knowledge needed to excel in the blue/purple team of cyber security. From series of online courses, YouTube lessons,
college lessons and many more, It's good to say I am now an intermediate cyber security analyst as I understand the basic concepts of how the cyber space works.
I hope to become a Soc analyst or Cloud computing specialist in the nearest future.

 Join me on my amazing journey as I learn every day the skills needed to excel in my domain.
